Endoscopy was negative at\n   that time. Colonoscopy revealed internal hemorrhoids. Differential for\n   current bleed includes diverticulosis (though not seen on recent\n   colonoscopy), radiation proctitis, ischemic colitis, infectious\n   colitis.

No further bleeding\n   overnight.\n   - advance diet to clears\n   - check HCT [**Hospital1 **] - transfuse to keep HCT > 30\n   - active type and screen\n   - IVF repletion\n   - two large bore IVs at all time\n   - PPI [**Hospital1 **] IV\n   - GI does not feel that scope can be pursued non-urgently\n   .\n   # Leukocytosis and fever: Unclear etiology.
