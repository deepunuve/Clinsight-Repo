    "brief_summary": "Cardiovascular disease continues to be the leading cause of death among women in the Middle East, including Jordan. Sex-specific data focused on cardiovascular disease have been increasing steadily, yet is not the subgroup of young women. This study focuses on classical and novel risk factors of cardiovascular disease in young women compared with older women.",
    "detailed_description": "This is the introduction of a new study at Istishari entitled: \"The Classical Risk Factors in Young Middle Eastern Women with Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease\" This is an investigator-initiated, cross-sectional, non-interventional, observational study.\n\nMedical research in Jordan is a basic responsibility of all medical sectors in the country. Despite the drastic growth and advances of medical services, the volume of the local medical research is, at best estimate, scarce. The emerging role of private medical groups, private hospitals, and residency programs in cooperation with other medical sectors and medical schools, in conducting, presenting, and publishing such studies should be encouraged and supported. A major indicator of judging the credibility and quality of any medical research project is to look at the conferences the research was presented at and the journals it was published in.\n\nThis is the 10th major project of the Jordan Collaborating Cardiology Group (JCC) and the first in cooperation with the Istishari Hospital Internal Medicine Residency Program (see Appendix 1. Timeline of JCC Group studies) The first project was JoHARTS that evaluated coronary risk factors and dyslipidemia in 5000 individuals with ACS, stable CAD, and non CAD patients. The 2nd project was CAPRIS evaluated the prognostic implications of hs-CRP in ACS from admission to 1 year. The 3rd project was MINTOR that evaluated onset, triggers, reperfusion strategies, and hospital mortality in more than 950 Jordanians with acute ST-elevation MI. The 4th project was GLORY study that evaluated the prevalence of glucometabolic states among ACS patients, prognosis up to 1 year, and TIMI risk score . The 5th was JoPCR1 that evaluated outcome post PCI in 2426 ACS and non ACS patients in 12 tertiary care centers for the incidence of death, stent thrombosis, revascularization, bleeding, impact of gender, DM, renal dysfunction, and age on outcome, GRACE, and CRUSADE risk scores. The 6th is the colchicine study of AF prevention in open heart surgery, one is completed with 1 mg dose and one is ongoing with reduced dose. The 7th and 8th projects are ongoing and study statin eligibility in patients admitted with MI (Statin EPIC) and decade or more survivors after coronary revascularization. The 8th was the Jordanian AF study which evaluated patients with AF in ambulatory and out-patient settings. The 9th was the JoCORE study that evaluated acute CV events due to the stresses of the covid-19 pandemic.\n\nOne population subgroup is under studied in the world literature as well as the local literature. The young women who have documented CVD. This group represents only a small proportion of the CVD population in all countries.",

The cardiologist may refer the patient to cardiac rehabilitation if appropriate and/or counsel them to increase their physical activity levels. The patients may opt to enroll in the monitoring phase of the study. They will be given a Fitbit pedometer and their Fitbit account can sync to their MyChart account.

    "brief_summary": "This is a prospective randomized clinical trial evaluating how two behaviorally-informed interventions (i.e., monthly report card and storyboard interventions) impact physician behavior, with the goal of closing care gaps in preventive care and disease management.\n\nIn particular, the monthly report card intervention seeks to elevate physicians' intentions to close their patients' care gaps, while the storyboard intervention seeks to prompt action by making patients' care gaps salient. The trial investigates the separate and joint impacts of the proposed behaviorally-informed interventions on encouraging physicians to close their patients' care gaps.",
    "detailed_description": "Despite the existence of evidence-based clinical guidelines on how to manage the health of patients with cardiovascular disease that have been shown to improve cardiac function and survival, significant gaps in care persist and optimal medical therapy is often under-utilized. For example, guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), statin and aspirin therapy, and blood pressure control are cornerstones of effective management of patients with cardiovascular disease or heart failure. However, current dashboard data indicate that within the UCLA Health system, these medical therapies remain under-utilized.\n\nAs part of the quality improvement (QI) initiative sponsored by the Division of Cardiology at UCLA Health, this trial will examine the independent and joint impacts on care gap closure of (1) sending monthly behaviorally-informed emails to physicians with personalized feedback on care gap performance and (2) enhancing the visibility of the open care gaps in the electronic health record upon patient encounter.\n\nEligible physicians (i.e., UCLA Health Cardiologists) will be randomized to one of four conditions based on a 2 (monthly report card intervention: receive vs. no receive) x 2 (storyboard intervention: receive vs not receive) between-subjects design:\n\nIn the no intervention (control) condition, physician participants will receive quarterly emails with their performance report card (status quo).\nIn the monthly report card only condition, behaviorally-informed monthly emails will be sent to inform physicians of their performance and elevate physicians' intentions to get more of their patients to close care gaps.\nIn the storyboard only condition, the visibility of care gap banners in the electronic health record (EHR) will be enhanced, which will promptly remind physicians of each patient's care gaps at the start of a patient-physician encounter.\nIn the monthly report card and storyboard condition, physicians will receive behaviorally-informed monthly emails and be reminded of each patient's care gaps via the EHR storyboard during patient-physician encounters.\n\nThe trial will include physicians participating in an existing UCLA incentive program, as of October 1, 2023, who have a panel size of above 50 patients. In August 2024, new physicians who are eligible for the incentive program and have at least 50 patients in the panel will be randomly assigned into one of the four conditions and become part of the study sample. Randomization will balance for physicians' baseline performance, subspecialty training, years out from training, and estimated panel size.\n\nMonthly performance feedback emails will include physicians' performance on eight cardiology care gaps, their projected earnings in the current quarter and their earnings in the previous quarter. Care gaps include the following: (1) statin or PCSK9 inhibitor use, (2) aspirin use, (3) beta blocker use, (4) angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, or angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor use, (5) mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist use, (6) SGLT2i, (7) average HCC/RAF score, and (8) blood pressure control.\n\nAnalysis Plan:\n\nThe investigators will use patient-level linear regression models, where the response is a 1/0 indicator of whether the patient has completed any of the open care gaps, with cluster-robust standard errors at the physician level.\nThe primary regression model will look at the main effect of the report card intervention and the storyboard intervention.\nIn a secondary regression, we will investigate the joint impact of the two interventions, including a report card x storyboard interaction.\n\nControl variables include:\n\nPatient-level care gap closure (i.e., whether patients closed any of their open care gaps, excluding HCC/RAF score, during the six months before the intervention delivery). For patients who were not in a given physician's panel as of six months before the experiment, mean values across the panel will be imputed.\nPhysician characteristics (gender, years out from training, subspecialty training within cardiology) and panel size.",
