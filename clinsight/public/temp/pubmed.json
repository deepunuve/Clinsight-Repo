    "Abstract": "Risk stratification is important in patients with post-cardiac arrest syndrome. The Post-Cardiac Arrest Syndrome for Therapeutic Hypothermia (CAST) and revised CAST (rCAST) scores have been well validated for predicting neurological outcomes, particularly for conventionally resuscitated patients with post-cardiac arrest syndrome. However, no studies have evaluated patients undergoing extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation.",

    "Abstract": "Diffusion imaging holds great potential for the non-invasive assessment of the glymphatic system in humans. One technique, diffusion tensor imaging along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS), has introduced the ALPS-index, a novel metric for evaluating diffusivity within the perivascular space. However, it still needs to be established whether the observed reduction in the ALPS-index reflects axonal changes, a common occurrence in neurodegenerative diseases.",
